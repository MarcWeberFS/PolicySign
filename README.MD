# Project Overview

This project was developed as an end of module exam for software engineering 2. For ease of access and local examination for teachers, the access keys for AWS S3 bucket, App Password to Gmail, and MongoDB were provided and hardcoded within the application properties. The access was revoked after receiving a grade and making the repository public.
